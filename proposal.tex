\section*{Project Proposal}
\label{sec:org4e95926}

\subsection*{Description}
\label{sec:orgfa6e35b}
A cooking game take place in a 3-D simulating kitchen, where the player is able 
to move aroud in first person to select and deselect ingredients and use tool 
objects to interact with these ingredient objects.There are several dish options
 and the player is able to choose one to cook. 
For each dish, there is a given receipt and the player first picks the 
ingredients from a table of vegetables and meat, and secondly uses the tools
(such as knife, pan, oven etc.) to handle with the ingredients and cook the
dish.

\subsection*{Code Objectives}
\label{sec:orgc8f7b4b}
Some objectives and goals that need to be fulfilled in the production of this 
game includes constructing the 3-D models for ingredient objects, tool objects
furniture in the kitchen, as well as the kitchen room itself. Appropriate event
handlers will be needed include mouse clicking to select objects and keyboard keys
to move around inside the kitchen room. Additional features include animation 
of when food objects split into smaller pieces when cut using a knife object, as 
well as gravity features for objects when they are dropped, momentum of objects
when interacted with, appropriate textures for the furniture, the room, and food
and changes in colour/texture when food is cooked or prepared.
